"Good advice. Achievable chunks is important. I just set one thing I haave to do and do that. Keeping the first one short, a 10 minute task being ideal. Once you can say ""Good, Ive completed that"" it helps me get onto the next one. If its a longer task break it down into small chunks. For example if I have to read, lets say, a 100 page document I will set myself a target of read the first 10 pages, then stretch my legs. Maybe make a cup of coffee or have a piss (the first leads to the second making natural breaks). Do the next chunk, stop, stretch my legs, next chunk, etc.

"These other suggestions are great. If you're looking for regular volunteering I'd search online for local organisations and/or those that match up with your interests and values. So if you're passionate about climate change, cycling, education, whatever, look for those issues and search for a charity. Trustee roles would be great, you'd get to support them over a long period of time and help shape and support it. Getting On Board have a lot of advice about trusteeships. 

There are organisations like Pilotlight and Reach volunteering that help match people up with roles. If you're into money type things, Pro Bono Economics does the same. 

You can also search for your local council for voluntary service (CVS). They'll often have local opportunities advertised if you want something more ad hoc. 

It helps in all these examples to understand how much time and capacity you have, and what kind of roles or activities you want to do. Being realistic with yourself up front is really helpful, it means you can find roles that fit well, and you don't over commit yourself or leave a charity struggling a bit without promised support.",uk,1,real

I'm the same as you. I work so much better the 3 days of the week I'm in the office, and on WFH days I've procrastinated the entire day when at my worst.

It's not the job. The work I'm doing is actually quite fun. For me, it's the lack of pressure I get from being surrounded by people who will call me out for being lazy. My brain can't resist the procrastination when there's no one to keep me in check. There's also the fact that the quicker I work, the sooner I can leave. Whereas at home, I'm already surrounded by the things I want to get back to.

"*Hawksmoor* by Peter Ackroyd.

It's a novel about the construction of the Hawksmoor churches following the Great Fire of London. Meticulously historically researched, it plays with the conspiracy theories surrounding Nicholas Hawksmoor, the architect, which say that he was an occultist and deliberately incorporated pagan symbols into his designs. In the novel, he performs rituals and murders while constructing the churches. While his contemporaries, like Christopher Wren, are building airy temples to reason and enlightenment, Hawksmoor is building sinister structures that trap shadows, inspire awe, and encode a hidden darkness into London's streets that Wren and his crowd will never dispell.

The novel flips between the 1600s and the 1980s, playing with simultaneity of time, implying that what happened in the past is echoing in the (then) present, that history is overlapping.

When I read it, I was a teenager working as a rickshaw driver in central London. I was a bit strung out, having had a bit of a rough go with my mental health and overdoing it in various ways.

I read this book while learning and memorising the layout of the city, seeing how history overlapped in the architecture and how there were echoes of the past everywhere. I also had quite a few run-ins with the more dangerous side of the city, and couldn't help reflecting on how the violence and misery of the past persists into the present.

It's one of those ""some books find you at just the right time in your life"" situations, but it genuinely made me look at a city I'd lived in my entire life through fresh eyes. It also makes a great companion read to Alan Moore's *From Hell* and Iain Sinclair's *Lud Heat*, which both play in the same kind of occult London milieu.

"I did a foundation year, I'm finishing up my first year now. It was 100% worth it. For the record I am a mature student and started my foundation year as a 27 year old. I have found the last year of studying with the pandemic very challenging. 

However, I think if possible it may be beneficial to you to take a year out, focus on yourself, work on your mental health, develop your hobbies, get some part time work and just take a year to exist in the world without education. It will give you time to really think about what you want and if you still want to pursue your foundation year and degree you can (apply now but to start the following September). 

University can be overwhelming and stressful, I think if you have struggled with your A-levels due to having some difficulties recently, jumping straight into University when you aren't ready could be difficult. Don't underestimate the time it can take to get yourself into a nice, even place mentally, and rushing that journey in order to be ready for uni won't necessarily be what's best for you. 

All that being said, foundation years can 100% be worth it, you just need to work hard and be sure you're on the right path when you choose your entry point as you only get 4 years worth of funding so changing courses midway through can be problematic.

"Will Self's 'The Book of Dave' is set in a future London, after sea level rises have turned most of the country into an archipelago.

I also loved his 'How The Dead Live', which reimagines an area of London as populated by dead souls.

Nicola Barker has a Thames Gateway trilogy, loosely connected by being set in east London and Essex, as well as their themes. I enjoyed 'Behindlings' the most of those three, and I would also recommend her 'Clear' as a snapshot of London in the early 00s.

JG Ballard is one of those authors who captured the anomie and underlying rage of the suburbs better than most.

"As someone who suffers with mental health, I have been awful in the past at getting work done and working towards deadlines... not panic typing the last few days.

I’m now in third year and I was determined to turn over a new leaf. I stick to a sleeping schedule where I wake up between 8-9 everyday, I take melatonin supplements so I fall asleep 11-12 and don’t stay up til 3 like I would before. I have a good breakfast, and eat my 5 a day in a smoothie for brain food. Then I start work around 9:30-10 and work til 6, with 30mins for lunch. I sit as a 2:1 student and this year I’m hitting high 2:1/1.

My advice is 
1. Sleep schedule is so important. Get up at the same time everyday (max an hour difference if it’s the weekend) - also great for your mental health. 
2. Don’t overwork yourself or feel guilty for not doing more, it will come in time, and there are extensions for a reason. Your productivity is not determined by the word count. Be kind to yourself.
3. Eat better and frequently 
4. HYDRATE
5. Get some exercise in, even a 20 min walk is better than nothing
6. Surround yourself with students who want to do better, and work everyday. If you surround yourself with people who leave everything to the 11th hour, you will too (I did). The top 5 people you hang around with most shape who you are, pick wisely. 
7. Don’t drink mid week, save it til Friday/Saturday- this has been easier to do as clubs are closed!

"**Exercise is any bodily activity that enhances or maintains physical fitness and overall health and wellness.It is performed for various reasons, to aid growth and improve strength, prevent aging, develop muscles and the cardiovascular system, hone athletic skills, weight loss or maintenance, improve health, or simply for enjoyment. Many individuals choose to exercise outdoors where they can congregate in groups, socialize, and improve well-being as well as mental health.In terms of health benefits, the amount of recommended exercise depends upon the goal, the type of exercise, and the age of the person.**

"Firstly: are you sure it is the job/WFH situation that is making you feel like this?

We've all been living through a wierd, stressful time period, not just the pandemic but all sorts of other economic and social stresses (not to mention lots of loss and grief) and I think everyone is a bit strung out.

I would definitely try

1] talking to someone.  Not necessarily a therapist, maybe a friend

and

2]  shaking up your routine.  I don't know how much flexibility you have in your job but try compressed hours and taking one day off, try working a split shift or unusual hours, go to a co-working space, work from a cafe one day a week - basically anything to shift things around for you and see if it helps.

Good luck.  And if you find the solution you should let us know, so many people are feeling like this.",uk,1,real

"There is no need to be hard on yourself. Too strict and you'll continue being ashamed and anxious. But too relaxed and you'll be waiting for something to pull you out, but who knows what and when? 

I'm very much like you, but lately I've been picking it all back up. Yesterday I read an article talking about how the first couple of hours after waking up quite literally programs your brain on how it will take the rest of the day. Grabbing something physical to read instead of scrolling reddit, or stretching and drinking water instead of lying in bed and getting a coffee. That kinda thing. Entirely anecdotal but, I tried it this morning and I've blasted out more work today than I have in the past week. So there's that little morsel. 

But I know what it's like to just not get up until past 2. I'd say as a baseline, don't beat yourself up over it. This kind of cycle is one where you naturally end up putting it at the back of your mind, but the anxiety and shame lingers and it just makes it so much worse. Surely more students are feeling this way now than students who are not. It's not your fault, your way of life has been disrupted and nothing seems to feel right. Take some time to do your favourite thing and enjoy yourself. With that emotion and drive you can come back around when you're ready. If it seems impossible now, take it step by step and you'll be amazed how fast you can go.

£500k would pay off the mortgage and give me a tidy sum for retirement. That’s less than 20 years away, so those are the priorities.

Suggestions: Talk to yourself out loud about your work while you are working. Have a notebook and write down lists of things you absolutely *must* do in any given working day, and cross them off as you finish them. If you can, at least occasionally, time track and see where the bulk of your time wanders off too. If you are taking a break, set a timer. Talk to someone about them helping you with accountability; sometimes (often for me), it helps if you have someone you trust who can check in on your work and ask if you're still doing it, have made enough progress, etc. Exercise, get enough sleep, remember that caffeine is ultimately a trap for people like us; if you've ever had a cup of coffee and felt *more* tired afterwards, you should know what I mean.

"Won't be a popular answer, but I was struggling with this throughout lockdown.

I was open with my employer that no matter had I tried, I was endlessly struggling to do simple tasks after 5 years of successful promotions.

They signed me up for coaching of 10 weeks, and their recommendations was to return to the office, or leave to somewhere I could engage with people directly on a day to day basis. 

I returned to the office, and now I'm up again for promotion. Others haven't joined me, but I find it gives me a sense of purpose. I am there to do my job and go. I actually can now leave an hour early and use my teams on the commute home, so I find I actually get home at the same time I would leave working from home, and have a much more productive day.

And then walking along the walls, picturing what the city must have looked like before, before heading to the train museum, or yorvik. Or (as I'm more into the country) going to the moors/lakes for the day, climbing a hill and looking at the view whilst experiencing all of the fully immersive sensations (the wind, the gravel or mud underfoot etc): sure I could look at the same view on the internet, but I can't appreciate how it feels to be there.

That being said, normally I limit day trips to 2 hours travel each way (spend longer at the destination than travelling is my rule of thumb) so Edinburgh I'd probably suggest doing as an overnight stay: travel up after work on the Friday, find a nice pub for a pint, and then spend the next day exploring the place, visit the castle or underground city, climbing Arthur's seat.

That's interesting because I have a theory that Monty Python is a bit of a bigger deal abroad than in the UK these days.

As for what's replaced it, I think to a certain extent the answer is nothing really.

"I work hybrid now through choice, if I stay at home too many days in a row I lose motivation,  not just for work but to do anything and just become lazy. 

Do you have the option to go in a couple of days a week? Or work from another location like a pub, cafe or library, friend or family members house to mix it up a bit? I find even rearranging my room and work set up helps keep things a bit fresher.

Otherwise can you get involved in any other projects at work to keep things interesting? Speak to your manager about how you're feeling, they might have something else you can get stuck into.

Or focus on improving your personal life. Make some evening plans, go for a walk or run or whatever you like to do, get out of the house. Go for a lunchtime walk or pop to the shops.

Good luck!",uk,1,real

Work 9-5, dinner 6-7, exercise (5k/10k or gym) 7.30-8.30, then sit down and enjoy a good episode of a TV show 9-10.

Got into this routine recently and it really makes the weekdays fly in and I feel good about my self too. Sitting down to watch an episode of a show you are loving after both working hard all day and exercising is so satisfying. I don’t feel “guilty” at all seeing as I have done productive tasks all day long, would really recommend.

For motivation I just hate feeling sluggish and lazy, the thought of exercise is hard but every single time afterwards I am always glad that I’ve done it - my mental health would be so much worse without it.

The way you are living is no way of living. Don’t try to just cope with it. You’ve got to go to the source.

I find honesty is the best way forward from my own experience. Talk to your manager, explain the situation, ask for what resources there is to help, and take some time off to cope with it.

"As someone who recently graduated from their masters in September, I was in almost an identical situation to you. Uni all day Monday Tuesday (including catching up on work in the evenings), then work 4/5 days a week, whilst studying either before or after work depending on when my shift was. Did that for 12 months solid. It was absolute hell and the mental exhaustion/burn out can be awful. I’m also a care leaver so understand the added stress which comes with that too. 

HOWEVER…

I am now working in my dream industry, on good money, with evenings and weekends off. People used to say I should make the most of my final year as a student due to the long hours that come with a “proper” job (as they put it). However, I haven’t had so much free time since I left college. That sounds great right? Well that will be you soon. What you need to remind yourself is that every day, no matter what task it is that you’re doing (Uni or working) it is going to result in you getting to where you want to be. The continual slog day after day with what seems like no end in sight is your way to whatever end goal it is that you so dream of. It may feel like there’s no end in sight, but in 12/18 months time you’ll be out of the other end of the horrible education/studying juggling act that you’re in at the moment. See every task between now and the end of your masters as an “enabler” to a lifestyle that’s going to be whatever you want it to be. See your next lecture, deadline, shift, as a very small step towards the end of the struggle.

I had so so so many nights where I lay awake thinking exactly what you’ve said in your post. But I PROMISE you’ll make it out the other end and it will be entirely worth it. I guess to summarise the above, allow yourself to dream of what life WILL be once you finish your masters. At times the thought of simply having weekends off was the only thing that got me out of bed in the mornings and my head back into the books.

">I don’t know, so it doesn’t matter

Not it's not. Try re-reading.

I'm well aware of the cultural significance of Monty Python. The point is that significance has faded greatly and it doesn't seem to be particularly popular with younger generations. Of Cleese's work, Fawlty Towers seems to have endured more, I hear that referenced more often.

Your argument was that Cleese's work in Python will ensure he continues to be widely beloved. My point is that it will not, because there are scores of younger people who only know him as a crotchety old man complaining about cancel culture and generally denigrating modern Britain. That's if they know him well at all, which I'd wager many will not.

>Noted that you can’t name a replacement

I gave you a more nuanced answer than just naming a replacement. I thought that might be more interesting and insightful than just naming shows. But there's loads and loads of great British comedy that younger people will find much more relevant and significant than Python. Google any list of best British comedies of the past 30 years and you'll find loads. The Office, The Thick of It, Fleabag, The Royale Family, Derry Girls. The list goes on and on.",uk,1,real

"Ah, I see. Well, depending on where you’re at with your studies, and exactly how much you’re disliking it, I’d strongly recommend finishing any course you’ve already started. I feel like very few people resent having completed a course, even if they don’t use it. Completing a qualification isn’t a commitment to staying in an industry, and in fact I think most people these days end up working in several sectors before they retire. You can also try looking into some part time work experience to see what the work environment feels like, as I think a lot of jobs feel very different to the academic version of the same field.

Going forward though, I would 100% suggest exploring what *lifestyle* makes you happiest. I worked in recruitment back in the day, and there’s compromises when picking a job, whether it’s salary, location, hours, duties, paperwork, rules, dress code, or whatever. And no job is 100% fun 100% of the time, not even ‘dream jobs’ like being a professional athlete, author, actor or artist (with those ‘fun’ jobs, the common denominator is unstable income/employment, and a job that bleeds into your personal life rather than letting you clock off at 5pm every day).

For that reason, whenever I’ve been approached for career advice from students I’ve told them to think in terms of *lifestyle* rather than job title/salary/prestige. What do you value most - free time or the satisfaction of doing something rewarding (but time consuming)? A chill life or getting to meet new people? A high salary or creative expression? Good job security or constant variety?

For me, I’ve found I value enjoying my work above most other factors. As a university instructor, I had some long and tiring days, but I’ve never dreaded going to work. Even on my worse day (new courses, training, stressful meetings, lots of grading to do, and so on) I was happy to get out of bed and go to work every single day. This is not something I experienced in corporate life or retail/hospitality.",uk,1,real

Worked in retail for 1 year, knew I needed an office job, got a call center job for experience, promoted to floor walker after 3 months, after a total 9 months of the worst ever job I bagged a role in a bank doing admin work.

At the bank I grinded and became a trainer in all but name only on 19k I then got promoted to assistant manager on 22.5k at age 23/24. Took an interest in Power BI and also started looking into accounting.

After 1 year as a manager at age 25/26 I got a role as a data analyst in a small company. I earned 25k and bought a flat with HTB equity scheme.

After 1 year at this job I jumped ship into an accounting analyst role on £30k at age 26/27. I'm now studying CIMA.

My path from here is to build up my programming skills alongside my CIMA studies over 4 years. Hoping a nice accounting management analyst career path will earn me some big cash.

"This thread is absolutely fascinating to me because I’m currently pondering this exact question in real life. Personally, money hasn’t ever really been my primary motivator (I’ve always just made sure to earn/save enough to get by, but never chased a particular income). 

So I can answer what I DID do in the past (despite not having the money): I spent my twenties focused on education, travel and volunteering, and primarily taught English to support myself. Really rewarding, but not usually highly paid, but I went into it with the expectation that at some point in my thirties it might be prudent to review my long term goals and finances. 

I’m now at that stage. The single biggest factor (which I didn’t anticipate a decade ago) is that I now have a stably employed partner whose income is currently sufficient to support the both of us. The upswing of that is I don’t have any immediate financial pressure. The downside is that regularly relocating for work is now a lot less practical than when I was single.

I guess what I’m saying is that we all have something that ‘limits us’, whether is financial (so many people in this thread are ‘tied down’ by their mortgage, and/or worried about retirement), personal (partners, children, parents, friends, communities etc.), or practical (health, legal stuff, and so on). So I’m not sure there’s really any scenario where we would truly feel free to do whatever we want.

On the other hand, if you’re willing to say ‘f***k it’, and not care about consequences (like losing friends or not having savings), there’s a lot you can do. In my twenties I didn’t care about being single, broke, far away from family/friends and not having a pension/mortgage/car. So maybe it’s mindset, rather than the amount of money?",uk,1,real

I wanted to do something I loved, but also be challenged with the possibility of earning a lot. I had always loved football - so I decided to get a job on football. I started writing blogs about different things, I did some coaching badges. I didn't know if I wanted to be a scout/analyst/coach so tried a bit of everything to see where I landed.  


Then about 5 years ago I hit upon an idea - analysis departments in football teams were growing quickly so I figured there would be new roles created that clubs didn't really have. So I focused on set-pieces, set-pieces can change games and I figured they would likely be one of these new roles created - and if you can prove that you can add goals to a team then that's something that you'll likely be well compensated for. So I wrote blogs and worked for free for teams for a couple of years, building my methods and reputation.

"05:40 alarm. Gym for 06:20. Five days a week. 

The first week or two will always be tough as it’s likely a reasonable change from your normal routine. Your body will adjust. 

The one thing you need to adhere to is a regular sleeping pattern though. For me 22:30 - 05:40. 

I tend to head out earlier for a drink if it’s a Friday or Saturday so even over the weekend I don’t deviate too much. 

If you hit Friday and Saturday hard you’ll struggle during the weekend. 

Biggest downside. I rarely sleep beyond 7am regardless of “bed time” so I ensure that when I am feeling a little drained I’ll either skip the odd morning and do an evening and try to sleep longer or a “de-load” work where I’m still working out but not as intense. Let my body recuperate.

I threw my A-Levels back in year 2, reconfigured the subjects I was doing, and ended up with A-C's across 6 subjects after a 3rd year of very hard work. It sorted me right out to be honest, because all my friends going to Uni and me not was *very* embarassing and *very* painful and also meant there wasn't much for me to do except work, devise study methods that worked for me. I did stupid stuff like gmaed the Biology syllabus to get 98.5% across all exams and coursework, for example.

My path out (3rd year A-levels) may not be your path out.

"Thanks for the question!

Dana was a classmate of Joeys at St. Rose when he experienced the car wreck with a drunk driver, and then the diagnosis of a brain tumor. After grammar school they drifted apart and she reconnected with him when he was bagging groceries. 
Dana had been volunteering at Sidewalk Film Festivals and had always been interested in movies and as she says in the trailer, “If anyone’s life deserved to be in a movie, it was his”. 

There were some really important moments in his recovery. Not being able to speak or walk to start. Befriending a NFL hero of his that gave him motivation to get better. His continued friendship with the NFL player to this day. His hard work and capacity for joy. 
His faith is important to him and his religion plays a role in the film as it defines many parts of his life. 

Equally as inspiring has been a Dana’s persistence in getting the film made. Her initial partner died at an early age after 90% of the footage had been shot detailing his early life. Finding an (Emmy Award winning) editor to take it on, having a nonprofit charity help in raising money tax free, etc. Over the past 12 years making the film, many of the contributors have passed away. It’s a film to honor their work as well. 
Dana is a first time film maker, stay at home mom and learning the ropes as she goes. 

She/we really want to give Joey and the public a glimpse into his inspirational story and show it at Sidewalk. We have never thought about distribution or recouping costs just getting attention to his humor and getting to know Joey. 

So, the TLDR is Joey’s great, funny, inspiring. Dana had always been into films and had put everything into making a film on his life.

I’ve found the getting out of the house thing really important. Selling stuff on Vinted gets me cycling or walking to drop things off at lunchtime, and gives me a sense of achievement when work isn’t ticking that boxes.

The thing that really works for me when I’m struggling to focus is lists! It helps me know what I’ve done and what I’m doing. When things were really bad I’ve kept a journal of literally everything work related I’ve done that day, as if it was going jn a CV or covering letter, which helped me feel like I was actually doing something and still a grown up professional. 

Finally, try music pomodoro. Basically, force yourself to focus on a work task for the length of an album. Listen to different stuff, and discover what works for you in terms of music doping. You might be surprised by what you achieve.

How would such a thing come about ? I would like to know how this thought came up. There are no double meanings in this.

I also take offence with the fact that malayalees did not have issues with invaders when we preserved our independence for much longer than the North Indians. Vasco da Gama landed in 1498 there was a gap of more than 200 years between 1498 and 1757, when British first won their first military victory. I would also like to remind op that a certain group of people from Uzbekistan came to India during 1526 to 1556 and fought wars with the natives, funny how those guys are indian now and their invasion is not to be fought against...... Do know of Portugese colony of Kerala, Dutch colony of Kerala, French colony of Kerala, Uzbek Kerala. Most probably you don't because they did not exist. Independence is not just independence from the British, but independence from other colonial powers too. Our methods were different and we stayed independent from a larger number of enemies, not just the British. It is just not fashionable to speak about our activities against the other invaders namely the Portugese, the uzbeks, the Dutch, the Afghans, the French, the British in chronological order.",india,1,real

"Not exactly, Khilafat got traction in India because Congress (read Gandhi if you like) see a chance to align Muslims against the British. Before that Khilafat was merely an intellectual campaign. It was Congress that changed that into a mass movement here in India. 

Using religious sentiment of people for political gain is a strategy used by our leaders for a long time. Remember how the first war of independence started. It's started  from a rumour that the bullet has fats from cows and pigs. 

And No, it's not about any global caliphate. The worldwide caliphate is a 21st-century thing. After the first world war, the Turkey caliphate was crumbling, but they managed to get a promise from the allies that they'll (Britain and France) will help Turkey to protect the Caliphate. As we know allies don't even like that idea. (Read about the Sykes-Picot agreement.) So the allies withdrew from the promise. Khilafat movement was thus a pan Islamic movement (Mass movement happened mainly in India only.) to pressure the British to keep their promise to Turkey's Sultan. Of course, the British won't have any of it and there were a lot of other promises too. Some to the French, others to various Sheikhs, clans and other leaders in the Middle East. And there was Oil too. How can an empire ignore Oil? 😋

Thus khilafat movement began and Gandhi saw a chance. To be honest, many Muslim leaders including Jinnah advised Gandhi not to mix politics with religion. But it was Gandhi's thing, you know. 😊",india,1,real

Reminiscent memories , school days were less stressful ,I used to come home soon and watch power rangers. 
Neighbors were very friendly ,I used to get free Palamphori from Neighbor aunty. 

Greenery and grass ,I would roll in mountain grass on school lunch break lol it was like race. 

Hospitals charged mostly less for treatment ,in Chennai we buy medicines directly from Pharmacy but in Kerala(Kanur)it was very tough we had to get doctor prescription every time and other than that only problems I faced was spiders and snakes.

We used to catch fishes in canal then fry them and eat it ahhh good old memories wish I had smart phone those days to record those scene ,I can understand why they say it as God own state.

Trivandrum is one of those few "" it's not a place, it's an emotion "" places.
The underrated idyllic picnic town. Trivandrum is pure poetry. Unfortunately majority don't realize it. I guess you have to be here for a while to truly understand the essence of why it is. If it's just a weekend you get to be here, including visits to Ponmudi, Varkala & Kovalam, the various day sights in the city like the Padmanabha Temple, Museum & Zoo and topping off with an evening walk through the city to Kowdiar, Kuravankonam, and embracing the growing night life of the fast developing technovalley stretch, would give a great trial. Bonus points if you get to visit lesser known spots like Perumathura, Anjengo, Kadinamkulam, Murukkumpuzha, various rocks like Madavoorpara & Sasthanpara, Palode, Bonacaud + easy accessibility to numerous spots in Tamil Nadu ( Kanyakumari, Nagercoil, Chitharal etc. )and Kollam ( Monroe island, Jatayu Para, Thenmala etc.)
Also props for how relieving Trivandrum feels when you come from a busier city, to see how clean and well managed the city is, and with roads that ensure headache free traffic.

The Trivandrum district is like a mini Kerala experience. Hills, beaches, backwaters, modern city, quaint towns,   paddy fields - you name it, everything can be found here if you look right, that too accesible at lesser distances than the preferred hub cities like Kochi.

"Just how much they focused on idols/art and the idea of ""seeing and being seen.""  
   
Other religions certainly have their own forms of idols and art, but they're never really explored in a spiritual sense. You may see depictions of Jesus or the virgin Mary in Christian churches or Siddhārtha Gautama or Mara in Buddhist temples but they're never any more important than any mundane piece of art. They help less imaginative worshipers understand who/what the religious leaders are talking about but they aren't needed for the religion to work.  
   
Hinduism is unique in that they treat their idols/art *as* the gods themselves rather than simple depictions. They have special rites to worship and give life to the idols. And they personify them by doing things like ""waking them up"" in the morning by shedding light on the work. The idols allow the worshipers to see the god and the god to see their disciples, which is why Hindu art always has such large and uncanny eyes.    
But they recognize that an idol becoming an incarnation of the god they're worshiping is a two way street. An idol who's abandoned by people or desecrated in some manner isn't infused with the god anymore and it's as worthless as trash. But that's okay because they can always make a new one.  
   
I especially found funny that after being done with the Durga festival they just throw the idols away that they've been worshiping and parading around for the last week. My class promptly made a joke when we learned about it about how they literally yeet the idols after they're empty.",india,1,real

2) I don't know much about science or engineering subcultures either in India or globally but there is one quirk I can tell you about.

Ladakh: Leh was a cool town and the landscapes were unreal. I loved the big alpine salt lakes. Be careful with acclimation. We came by road from Srinigar. Kashmir was beautiful, but even a decade ago felt tense. 

Himachal - spent a summer there basically lugging my 2 year old around while my wife did fieldwork. It wasn't super high where we were but it was rugged and lush. We were close to Palampur for part and Mandi for the other. We flew out of Dharmashala, which I liked slightly better than I expected.

The Nilgiris - sensing a pattern? I like mountains. These are in the south and are cool and misty. Some spots are rugged. Lots of tea is grown. 

Bandavgardh, Satpura, Kanha - National parks in Madya Pradesh I believe. We saw some amazing wildlife.

Kerala backwaters - staying on a houseboat for a few nights was a really cool experience.

Hampi - took a trip feom Hyderabad to see it. It was one of my favorite archeological tourist attractions in India.

"India had some of the most amazing sights but it was always a struggle. Walking around Delhi, some places would just smell like urine. Random people come up to you trying to sell stuff or scam you. You have different norms like while waiting in line for a train ticket, people will go body to body on you in the hot summer because if you don't others will cut in line. People don't wear deodorant as much as in the west so crowded places just smell more.

I did spend a night in a rural town doing the Golden triangle circuit and there were no beggars despite the people probably being less wealthy. 

I went to Rajasthan to see tigers and stayed at basically an all inclusive. It was a little weird because the staff was so attentive it was like having servants. I felt like the Batman movies with Alfred just there to serve you. No begging because it's basically like a gated community. 

Things like the Taj Mahal are popular for a reason and justifiably so. Dealing with all the hassles is just what you have to do to see it. If you go to less touristed areas I think the people have a much lower reliance on begging and don't do it as much.

The US has issues too. I run into unpleasant types on the train and now there are Venezuelan migrants begging in front of many stores. It's just it's way more intense in Delhi, on another level.

Food safety is an issue as well. If you always eat in hotels like many recommend then a lot of meals can be $10-20 so it's not as cheap as you might think. I saved the street food tour for the last day and did get minor food poisoning for maybe a week. Thankfully it didn't set on until after the plane ride was over.

Apart from politics, where even control seems to be slipping away to North Indians/Gujaratis behind the scenes, our beautiful Marathi culture, with its rich history including figures like Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, the Maratha Empire, and revered saints and poets like Tukuram, Mukundrao, and Eknath, is at risk. Our land boasts cultural treasures like Warli paintings, Paithani sarees, Lavani dance, Kolhapuri chappal, and more, yet our own culture is now under threat. It's disheartening to feel a lack of recognition, and at times, even disdain from other communities within our own region. 

It's high time we Marathis reclaim our influence, especially considering that Bollywood is situated in Maharashtra. Marathi should rightfully be given priority, not languages like Punjabi.

it's disheartening to witness. I implore you, let's unite, form a formidable alliance to champion our community. The naysayers will doubt, but we can't let that deter us. A small start is still a start – a spark that can ignite change. Marathis, it's time to rise.

"I don't think our design is better. Here's why. A bathroom might serve many purposes including bathing, disposal of excreta, washing, brushing of teeth, storage of related products, etc.
When you shower in an Indian bathroom, everything gets wet. The mirror, the toilet, the cabinets, the sink, everything. Do you like sitting on a wet toilet? I certainly don't. 

So I would like simply to segregate the wet and dry sections of the bathroom. By cordoning off the shower section by glass or curtain, and preventing the water from coming to the other side, you can achieve that. And indeed in most modern Indian apartments that is the same design that is being implemented. 

The bathroom is waterproofed anyway, I am not complaining about that.True, most American bathrooms are only waterproofed partially, and that is their design flaw. ",india,1,real

I don’t think you’re allowed to hike there without a guide, so we (just my husband and I, not a big group) hired a company in Joshimath that had good reviews online (though I can’t find the name now). For a very reasonable fee, something like $50-60/person/day, we had an English-speaking guide, a cook, a mule handler and two mules who carried all our stuff. 

We did the five-day trek to Pangarchulla. I’m thankful we didn’t have to carry our equipment and set up camp, because honestly I’m not sure I would’ve been able to handle it. I’ve spent my life at sea level and the altitude in the Himalayas really knocked me out. I didn’t get any altitude sickness symptoms like headaches, but I was just far more winded and exhausted than I normally would’ve been. 

We didn’t get to summit Pangarchulla because the weather didn’t cooperate on the day we were supposed to go up, but it was fine. The views all along the way were spectacular and every campsite spot was just stunning.

"I wanted to do B.Sc and become a scientist. My parents forced me to do engineering.

So, while doing mechanical engineering, I did as well as a person studying a degree without any interest could do, but couldn't get placement because mechanical being mechanical and me having done mechanical against my wish.

So, after completing engineering without any job, I came back home and stayed unemployed for 4 years. During this time I was giving exams for government jobs, which of course my parents wanted(duh!) But couldn't clear them, some after first stage, some after second stage. During my third year of unemployment, some friend of my family suggested my parents to admit me to CDAC course so that I might get a job. So, my parents, who believed during my school days that only mechanical had all the scope in the world and CS had ""no value"", now told me to do CDAC course. Having been unemployed for 3 years at this point, I had no option but to do this, so I did, even though I hated coding/CS.

So, I got selected in the topmost institute in CDAC and during placement I got placed in a software developer role. Now, after 4 years of unemployment, I started working in that company that mandated the new joinees go through a 3-4 month training program, and they will be confirmed only after that. Now after 4 months of training with meagre pay, some of us have been informed that there is a good chance that we would be ""released"" upon not meeting their criteria, which isn't clear in the first place.

My industry was falling quickly and there were no jobs available.

And now am earning twice that I did earlier. It's okay to compromise on CTC early on, experience is more important as a fresher, just to get a feel of corporate life and hierarchy is far more important.

All i can say is, 

1. Make sure you talk to your parents/close ones, don't feel ashamed of your situation, shit happens. You'll be depressed and frustrated and it's fine, never lose touch with people around you.

I believe in speaking truth, even if its hurtful. Downvotes may go to hell

A score of 200  in current trend is trash. Most average aspirants do manage to cross 350 any day in a difficult paper.

Neet UG is the easiest of all upcoming exams in medical field (Neet pg, neet ss, CMS upsc, PLAB, usmle).

If a person has a bad score in  neet ug, chances are he isn't fit for the next level of exams. Of course, exceptions exist, but they are called exceptions for a reason.

I'll be honest, take a maximum of 2 drops, but to be fairly honest, a jump to 600 from 200 is pretty impossibly difficult task. Just had a friend's sister take 4 years drop to from 350 to 550 and she still won't get any seat

The key to travelling in India is not where you go. It's about how you go about it - how much you're willing to spend, how open you are to new experiences, how chill you are (do not go to India if you're kinda high strung or anxious), etc. Don't believe the perception that India is only for rough and tough travellers either. If you have the money to spend, you can get some of the best luxury experiences in the world in India. If comfort and security is extremely important to you, expect to pay more than what most travel vloggers and tik toks claim you have to spend.

"First things first, distance yourself from these for sure. Always remember that [if you get bad grades, you need better friends.](https://youtu.be/RQd28DTVX98) Second, decide once and for all if you want to prepare for JEE or not. If yes, choose some YouTube channels for preparing. Don't stress too much because you can cover backlogs in the future, just don't stop focusing on what you're being taught today. If not, take a deep breath and stop taking any more stress from now on. You're in class 11, start today and do only as much as you'd need to pass if you're scared. Some of my friends who qualified JEE this year didn't even have 60% in class 11th. So chill. You can definitely pass 12th and state level college exams easily. Also, your college doesn't matter. Although I would agree that getting into an IIT or NIT makes your life easier (in terms of placement) but if you work hard enough, off campus is there (if getting a job is what you're scared about). 

About not attending online classes, I don't think anyone attends online classes for purposes other than attendance. It's like school only, where the real study happens only at home (or maybe coaching for some people). If you have internet, you have everything you need to qualify atleast JEE mains. So don't worry. Start working from today and you'll see progress.

"Sri Aurobindo is a learned man. He has read the Vedas after self study of Sanskrit. He was formally educated in Greek classics and poetry. He is well read in English, French, Latin, German literature, philosophy and poetry etc.. and as per OP's demands he is the only philosopher in the classical sense of the word who could give rational and solid critique on Western and eastern cultures and ethos.  Calling him a self proclaimed magician while quoting names like Yogananda (who himself praised Aurobindo in his autobiography) and Ramakrishna (Ramakrishna mission regularly puts out articles and booklets on Sri Aurobindo as they feel his philosophy aligns very much to their ideals) to be rationalists is just laughable. I believe it was Rabindranath Tagore who said ""Sri Aurobindo is the voice incarnate of India's soul"". 

Osho is a self proclaimed learned person who didn't even read the Vedas to understand the underlying symbolism to start critiquing Indian culture. Sri Aurobindo is a Rishi in the truest sense of the word. All this becomes extremely clear when you compare Aurobindo's Secret of the Veda to Osho's comments on the Vedas calling them ritualistic garbage asking for money and fame. That useless hobo better stick to critiquing Dostoevsky's translated works. The funny thing is Osho praises both Buddha and Shankaracharya while Shankaracharya's whole work was to abolish the nihilistic philosophy of Buddhism from India and reinstate Vedanta. Osho actively worked against this culture praising Buddhism and Taoism and throwing bones to the Upanishads and Yoga every now and then, pleased everyone, earned a name for himself and accomplished nothing ultimately.

">Do you think you would have been this successful if you hadn't met with the accident ?

Not at all. I had turned into a stereotypical carefree engineering student, back in school itself. Chasing highs, loafing around, and neglecting studies. The subjects were boring and difficult, so that didn't help. I loved computers but never chemistry or physics. Had picked up some other bad habits as well. 

It was sort of my rock bottom. Every wrong decision I took out of naivety led me into that situation. That was a painful slap of reality which shook me right up to the core. Sure I would have gotten into some engineering college, slacked my way thought it, get a job in some IT labor shops, probably mba or something later on, but this is different. not saying that I'm happy that it happened, that would be too sadistic of me.

These [10 Differently-Abled Indians Who Are A Big Inspiration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXh8hJLNEUw) will do more than just motivating you,india,1,real
"1. The people and their frankness. I genuinely love the straightforwardness and no-bs talk between people. There’s no like overly-fake politeness or exaggerated emotions that you have to show - at least to the extent western countries have it. You can have the most meaningful and intellectual conversations too. 

2. The Greenery for sure. Especially when there’s mazha and you’re just sitting in your appachen’s verandah watching it fall on the greenery. The sukkum that you get from that is unmatched. 

3. Sense of community. Where I stay in Kerala, everyone in the neighbourhood and town knows each other. I genuinely feel safe walking the roads, even through forest-y areas, to meet an aunty or uncle nearby because I know the people will have my back if something happens. Not to mention you will always have an ammachi or aunty calling out to you when you pass their house and checking in.

"Brother a lot of things you've written resonate with me.    
  
In my experience that numbness comes because we suppress important aspects of our life and pretend they don't matter anymore - for example in my case I pretend like I'm some badass who doesn't care for other's approval but in reality I crave people appreciating me. This is just one example, there's tonnes of such things I suppressed and eventually stopped feeling much of anything at all.    
  
Mindfulness and meditation is something that helps I feel. Life isn't about blocking negative emotions, instead you feel them in all their intensity and let them pass. If I had a bad interaction with someone and I 'suppress' whatever negative emotions arose in me, it doesn't mean the negative emotions don't exist anymore, they'll just haunt me for years to come instead. The better way is to let it take over and no matter how humongous the pit in my stomach seems, it will pass in no more than 5 minutes.  
  
You can't just block the negative emotions, if you try that you block all positive emotions as well - it's an all or nothing game. 
  
Another 'hack' is to exercise regularly so that you have happy hormones flying around on your system. You will be surprised how the same situation seems so very different before and after you get the injection of happy hormones.    
  
It doesn't get better in a day, it's a process to heal decades of trauma. Of course if you feel you need professional help you should definitely go for it.

"“My parents are in NO mood to talk to him. They feel ashamed about what they will say to society and relatives” : This right there is the biggest problem and the cause for this under confidence

As a society, we don’t teach kids to deal with failure and don’t instill the belief that failure is a necessary step to the path to success. That failing is okay. Whats important is to learn from failure, get up and try again. 

As parents, their job is not just to brag about their kid’s achievements to gain social capital or hide their face when things don’t go well. Their job is to do these:

1) Talk to your brother with kindness and tell him failing is okay. An exam is not what defines him
2) talk to him to understand why did the failure actually happen ( honesty is important here, should not be a blame game)
3) Take steps to fix the shortcomings identified in 2 - maybe they get him coaching for math!

"> so that I can run on the covered platform

what? You mean jog? That's a new one. Doesn't anyone stop you? 

Anyway here are my tips - 

1. I carry these things whenever i have to be out the whole day which includes going to work too - Water, Sanitizer, Wet tissues, Strong perfume/deo, Power bank, some dry fruits, emergency wallet with atleast Rs 2000/- and driving licences, one debit/credit card and identity proof. Also an umbrella/raincoat for monsoons. 

2. When traveling, always factor in 30 to 60 minutes extra each way. This ensures you reach either early or on time wherever you want to go. Reaching early or on time is always better than late. 

3. Have cooked food when out, or carry your own snack. Always carry water because you never know when you may need it. 

4. Cab apps are helpful. Most people dont even know they exist despite the marketing buzz. I was stuck on the harbour line due to heavy rains a few weeks ago, Almost everyone in the train decided to wait for the train to move and many decided to go home by hunting for cabs. I just walked 5 minutes away from the station and got myself an Ola to go back home. Easy peasy.

"I feel everything you say, man. I followed one motto while studying for the NEET - work hard, play hard.

Like other Redditors have mentioned, you just gotta find the balance between studying and relaxing by making a schedule, figuring out at what times of the day you happen to be the most alert and active, and so on. I used to go entire days relaxing and not studying anything and that is okay! But do try and go over the syllabus at least once. Use Youtube vids if you can. 

And do NOT skip out on proper meals or sleep - because let's be real you'll have to do sacrifice both of them while in college, especially the food lol.

(I'm two years into the college life already, that's how I know rip)

One more thing would be to ensure your board examination marks are on-point, because it's always a criteria while applying to any college.

And the most important thing imo is - don't feel discouraged if you don't get in; it DOES NOT MEAN THE END OF THE WORLD. I couldn't clear NEET inspite of giving it twice but I did get into a really good college soon enough.

The last thing would be to pretty much ignore what your relatives say, because most Indian relatives have nothing better to do other than compare and talk shit about everyone all day, every day.

"It's not a myth. It's a reality. Just google about the demographics and you'd find businesses owned by Marathis that can be counted on fingers. 🙂. Maharashtra is the most advanced state of India but Marathi people are very innocent and tricked by outsiders easily. 😔

Also in my opinion the number of medium, small scale businesses matter equally when it comes to judging how successful a community is. But sadly there also we see a domination by non-marathis. For eg: Hotels - Shetty's, Punjabis, Kirana - Marwadis, Malls - North Indians. Mumbai is mostly run by Gujjus these days. The percentage of Marathi here has fallen significantly. (You can google this).

I'm not saying that Marathis are weak, just saying the number is still comparatively lower despite being native to Maharashtra.

I know for a fact that Punjabi, Parsi people have monthly community meetings here in Maharashtra on how they can increase the influence of their community. Pretty sure other communities might have the same. Never came across such a thing done by Marathi people. I see young people want to be karyakartas here and go behind politicians.

Listen to this guy! I am a long hauler I had covid 4 months ago and symptoms are still not going away. I was anxious, stressed, had weird OCD, full of mental pressure. Mindful meditation has been really a game-changer for me, I am sure I would have fallen into depression if I didn't meditate.

I could only do volunteering and whatever free/affordable extracurriculars were available. Tons of people who were more privileged than me and the same race as me, went to better schools so I don't feel like the current system benefits students who are disadvantaged. This pattern is continuing and the richest in our community are going to the best state schools and private schools while everyone has to settle.

"Listen I don’t want to waste time on this since u r prejudiced enough. Nothing I say wud convey anything against ur prejudiced strong beliefs, which is the root cause of ur problem anyway. So am gonna keep this short and not gonna waste time further. 

I can tell u this. No one knows what’s right. Period. Everyone chooses to follow what makes “sense” to them. “Sense” is inherently individualistic rationalization. So u can’t find an universal answer on who is right.

Some believe magic is true, some believe miracles exist while some lean towards the contrary which strikes as more pragmatic. Some choose scientific proof. 

The problem with u is how u started the whole thread. When someone suggested Op to read JK, u felt the urge to attack by calling JK pseudo intellectual while promoting ur preaching of Aurobindo.

Right that moment, u have already lost the ability to “seek”. No matter what anyone says wudn’t get through ur mind. Because u r deeply biased already. If u really want to learn, go read other works. Try to be unbiased though it may be hard for you. 

Typically I don’t call other “gurus” as fake as I really don’t care. I read, experiment and follow what makes “sense” to me. But here I had to call out on Aurobindo because of you. Based on my years of study of different schools of philosophy, I think Aurobindo is very conflicted and preach metaphysics. Osho and Ramanamaharshi both responded to flaws in Aurobindo and how it contradicts the roots of spiritual seeking. 

Anyhow, u clearly lack the capability to hold a rational un-biased conversation. You started by an attack shooting someone else’s ideas. 

Your actions are the opposite of very spirituality u r trying to follow.",india,1,real
"Calling JK pseudo intellectual and quoting Aurobindo’s letter as reference.. The irony..

@Op - U can read both and decide for yourself to avoid bias. But if u r short on time, don’t waste ur time on Aurobindo or similar “saints” who’s entire effort is to show the “unlimited” powers of physical body only to succumb to it at the end. You don’t wanna waste time on these self proclaimed magicians.

Read JK, Osho, Vivekananda, Ramakrishna, Ramanamaharshi, Bharadwaja, Yoganand sort of works. Where they emphasize on experiential pursuit of spirituality beyond physical body.

Beyond Indian, u can read Zen masters such as Lao Tzu, Chang Tzu. Tibetan ones from Buddha, Milarepa. 

Surprisingly u will see all these masters speak very much alike. Helps in weeding out the “fake” gurus. Good luck.",india,1,real

"Sorry but I didn't read a single worthwhile tip in this huge nicely formatted comment. Not that I have any, but just saying. As an example:


>Hair: Get a proper haircut which suits your face shape. For the average Indian face, I'd recommend the tapered cut[1]  . Medium in the middle and faded on the sides. Long hair styles look shabby and are hard to groom. Apply some pomade or wax to hold hair in place.

What is an 'average Indian face'?! There is no such thing! Hairstyles are completely dependent on face cut and you can't get a hair cut based on the average Indian face. That's like buying shoes the size of an average Indian shoe.


'Buy quality products', 'exercise', 'buy nice things' 'experience the tougher life' is not jugaad, it's as generic as internet advice can get.

The food was incredible for starters. I barely saw any other tourists there the whole time. Maybe not any? The night market was great and I went to a fair ground by a lake and saw some great temples. I think one was called Swami Narayan which was really special. Went out to some wells and also to Gandhi’s ashram. And the textile museum. And the beautiful Jama Majid.

I have experienced several heavy monsoons where there were 5 - 10 feet of water logging in marshland developed areas. We used to be confined for a week to 10 days. It was followed by all kinds of sickness, madras eye, fever, cold et al.

We use to have regular kodai mazhai or summer rainfall in the afternoons during summers. This almost disappeared from the 70s except for a few occasions. Occasionally they use to have hail stroms.

We were warned never to bath in the Sea, if we see sea animals on the beach floor. We were trained to run far away from the sea shore. Heavy bird activity followed by abscence of birds, insects signified impending floods.

"Man, i know someone who has similar problems and he says it's due to severe dopamine desensitization and hypofrontality as a result of him abusing something.

I'm no doctor but i'll share what i know about it . Make what you must of it.

Basically, what i've heard is that all forms of addiction overload the brain's natural reward circuitry which runs on various neurotransmitters,especially dopamine.

Basically addiction is habit loop gone in overdrive, addiction provides repeated unusually large bursts of dopamine and opiods over a long time in brain as a response of which brain reduces the number of dopamine and opiod receptors in the brain to compensate. As soon as 'the high' of neurotransmitter due to using a substance passes away , the brain returns to regular transmitters lever but there are not enough receptors so to the brain natural activities which where fun are not fun anymore as the brain has lower number of receptors to absorb the dopamine and opiods provided by natural activities. Fatigue, low motivation, depression, difficulty at tasks etc. are also observed effects.

TLDR , you really should check out dopamine desensitisation and hypofrontality  in addiction. Quit alcohol and weed , like permanently quit. It might suck but its the only way things get better.",india,1,real

When I first learnt of him,I had such high regards for him esp learning of his run with DMRC as I live there. But during the conversation,I wanted to discuss the politic situation of India and kerala. He could be described as a genius in the technical field and very nicely put, inept and ignorant in his political understandings. He loosely said that religious tensions do not exist/is not a problem in india. Upon hearing that,I lost my conscience for a second and then regaining myself I calmly tried to have a discussion with him and he was not having any of it. It became too awkward since and I’ve never visited again 💀💀💀

Later on,my friend sent me this interview of his where he talks about a variety of topics you can have a look yourself.

*  raising the punishment for violations to up to three years of jail. 
* the fine has also been increased to up to Rs 50,000 for the employers 

* The current law prohibits employment of children, aged below 14 years, only in 18 specified occupations and 65 processes and regulates the conditions of working of children in other occupations/processes.

Jan 2020 the girl ended up cheating on me and it broke me emotionally. I didnt appear for my GATE exam(but fortunately i was placed). August 2020 i started working and started dating someone else. I was unhappy with my job, felt like I wasn’t living upto my potential, my salary was 18k per month so I decided to quit the job and start preparing for GATE. Feb 2021 left my job. March 2021 the girl was lying to me the whole time and she was already in a relationship with someone else, i was just a backup for her. Again emotionally broken.

"We're bombarded with statements of abstract pride in our various birth identities - national, religious, state, linguistic, caste, subcaste - right from a young age in our homes, in schools, by media, in public discussions. 

By statements of abstract pride, I mean slogans like ""be proud of your ancient traditions"", ""be proud of your warrior or scholar caste"", ""be proud of your language that has produced so many authors"", etc. 

There is no deep thinking or reasoning in it really. Identity pride by itself, standalone, is seen as an intrinsically good thing. We are taught to feel proud first without any ""because X and Y"" reasoning. Ground realities about our society don't really calibrate its level in most of us. Reasons and anecdotes to explain the pride are mostly ex post facto justifications. 

Identity pride is a double-edged sword. Total inferiority complex and defeatism are also bad, and pride injects some motivation to aim higher as a society regardless of ground realities. But too much pride makes us blind to ground realities and criticism. Calibrating pride requires honesty and critical thinking. Unfortunately, neither of those are core characteristics of our culture and so don't influence our upbringing, thinking, education system, or public discourse.

"Most home kitchens have paring knives because that's how we cut stuff traditionally. Chef's knife would be kinda useless, most households don't have a cutting board. 

Agree about lack of sartorial awareness.

EDIT: To elucidate, paring is a technique. Indian home food mostly uses cuts that let housewives pare, instead of finer cuts like julienne that need a cutting board and bigger knife. Therefore, we have more paring knives. Our mums are wizards at paring, plus it lets them watch TV and cut veggies, because it's all in the hands.

Using a chef's knife would require people to learn a new technique, i.e. putting veggies flat against a cutting board and chopping them. It is difficult for people who've been cooking for 10-40 years to suddenly do knife work in a new way. Therefore, it is a tip that ignores how we work, instead it just parrots what the American internet says ""hurrdurr buy a good knife do u evn benchmade"".

One of the very first organized protest against colonizers was from Christians here. Look up Coonan cross oath.

There are a lot of Malayalees from Independent era in national scene. Indian union as it is now owes a lot to VP Menon who managed Accession of 500+ princley states to India. VK Krishna Menon is another international figure from Home rule movement to Non alignment. Sardar KM Panikkar is another figure whose Asia and Western Dominance is considered the turning point in non colonial view point on oriental history. Dakshayani Velayudhan is the first and sadly only dalit women in constitutional assembly headed by Ambedkar.

Stories of revolutionaries are not so straight forward because everyone who revolted against colonialism gets a stand at the common history of freedom struggle that we learn in school, mostly because of Travancore being a princely state like many pointed out.

( A few of them are amongst the finest peices of art I have seen) while others might be a simple rock or a boulder worshipped (we even a famous icon in a costal town called Puri that is legit half sewn, representing the inherent imperfection of creation)

But Bengali Hindusim specialises in temporary icons. They are bulit of straws, clays and papers, worshipped during their festival and then immersed. A few ancient families that do the Durga Festival are literally building the same old icon for like 300 years, so like looking at them is almost like looking at history. Some of these families have a consecrated area where the idol is worshipped during the festival and that place is kept empty for the rest of the year. The deity dwells there metaphysically for the year to return in a concrete form during the festival.

Afghanistan beat Australia this year and advanced to the semis, USA beat Pakistan and Ireland to qualify for the Super 8s, Canada were pretty good too for the games they played and beat Ireland.

"> You can reuse the tea to make tea again.

You shouldn't be doing this. Tea leaves release lead on extended boiling (or repeated boiling). The correct way to make tea is to wait until the water/milk is almost ready to boil (bubbles just start to form) then add tea leaves. Wait for it to come to a boil, then simmer for 2-3 min before turning off the flame. If you want strong tea, add more tea leaves, don't boil it longer.

> Always hibernate your PC (standby is issue due to power cuts) just make sure you set your hiberfile.sys to an HDD, not SSD if you have one.

I'm not sure what you mean by this one. SSD are still persistent storage and will ensure that your PC restores from hibernation much faster. It's possible you're confusing SSD with the RAM caches present on some hard drives.

The second time I couldn't pay the fine so gave my laptop as the collateral, took the bus went home got my wallet and showed him the first class pass i had. He was not willing to let me go so he fined me for ticketless travelling in second class for the least amount. It was Rs 250/-.

I argued that since I've already paid the railway the fare for the entire month and i have brought the pass so it is not a case of ticketless travelling. He didnt budge. Called him a chor and stormed out of his office.

Sounds okay but I honestly believe if there was more money for more officers actually on the shift you’d easily see that figure reach 80%.

A lot of the stuff that goes undetected is because the enquiries needed are deemed disproportionate.

Rightly so crimes against the person are prioritised, robbery, assault, attempt murder, murder and so on all have quite high into the 90-100% detection rates.

But what that does mean is, if your car gets vandalised or your window gets smashed because it’s an insured loss, because ultimately you didn’t really get hurt resources will not be used to get you closure or justice because somewhere there’s a guy on the loose that will happily stab you over a drunken argument.

"United were founded in 1878 as Newton Heath and were renamed to the present name in 1902. During this time, local newspapers such as the Manchester Evening News, as well as national newspapers, used to shorten the name of the club from ‘Manchester United’ to ‘Man U’ to save precious space on the printed paper. That’s it. This is the not-at-all sinister history of the term ‘Man U’.

There are many offensive gestures and songs that mock the Munich tragedy of 1958. These are brought out mainly by supporters of Bolton Wanderers, Leeds United, Liverpool and Manchester City in descending order of regularity. Even as recently as the game against Leeds at Old Trafford and the 6–2 battering they received, ‘Munich’ was trending on Twitter thanks to their scummy fans.

However, ‘Man U’ is not at all relevant in context of Munich. The reason it is isn’t used anymore because the alternative terms ‘Man United’ or simply just ‘United’ are used instead. I have spoken to many, many matchgoing fans who have attended games at Old Trafford for more than 50 years, and without exception, they have no idea where this story of ‘Man U’ being offensive came from.

It's definitely worth getting a bike if you don't have one. Then you can get around FAR without it costing you per-journey. And you get fit.

That was pretty much how I survived lockdown, it was in the rules and I got super fit and healthy. Thankfully it was a dry sunny lockdown 1.0. And the weather is good now.

"I've felt this way before and this is what helped me through it:

If you can't shift these bleak feelings, carry on anyway, in spite of them. 

Instead of thinking for too long about what you don't have, or what could possibly go wrong, focus on what you do have. Enjoy what you have. Make the best of what you have. You've got a fantastic girlfriend; enjoy your time together. Even if you hate your job, go to work every day thinking that you're going to do the best at it that you possibly can. It's where you are for now: give it your best while you're there.

You can't see what's going to happen in the future, but you can make plans for it, which is a lot more positive than worrying about it. Worry is a bastard and you have to stop feeding it. Do things now that might help you one day. Look into film-industry jobs. See what's there. See if there's anything you can do in your spare time to make you better qualified to apply.

Get outside and get moving. Get off a tube stop earlier, or a few bus stops earlier, and walk. Go to a bit of London you don't usually go to. Hampstead Heath; Wimbledon Common; Richmond Park; the river walk from Kingston to Barnes Bridge. A long walk often brings a good clear stretch of thinking with it, and will hopefully give you a better perspective than this one, where everything seems too big and awful to let you carry on.

There is no magic way to make your worries suddenly vanish, but you can reduce the overwhelming size of them in your head by focusing on other things (plans to get work in the film industry; side projects; interests; anything but feeding the worry bastard) so that your worries don't feel so defeatingly enormous any more.
